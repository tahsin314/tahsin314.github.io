                <div class="title">Web Application Project Got Accepted at SIIM</div>
                <div class="description">Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH), which refers to bleeding inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and intensive medical intervention. In case of an emergency, it is necessary to urgently diagnose the subtype of IC from brain Computed Tomography (CT) scans. However, in hospital emergency rooms in low-resource countries, a skilled radiologist is almost non-existent, and an emergency medical officer has to make this urgent and critical decision. This may lead to missed diagnosis, especially in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage which often shows subtle changes in the CT image. In this work, we have developed a web-based AI tool for generating colorful heatmaps over the grayscale anatomical 2D CT image slices identifying the possible regions of the subtype of acute IC. The tool can be used by radiologists for AI-based assistance for making a more accurate and faster diagnosis. Our <a href="https://github.com/tahsin314/Intracranial_Hemorrhage_Web_App">Web Application for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection</a> got accepted at the <a href="https://siim.org/default.aspx">Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) 2020</a> Conference. Currently, the project is being supported by <a href="https://brainstation-23.com/">BrainStation 23</a>. They have deployed a web tool called <a href="https://www.radassist.net/">RadAssist</a> using our deep learning model.

                <div class="description">Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). It can be cured if treated at an early stage; otherwise, it could lead to permanent blindness. Detection of the stage of diabetic retinopathy is a challenging task even for doctors. <a href="https://aravind.org/" target="_blank">Aravind Eye Hospital</a> in India collected thousands of retinopathy images and hosted <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/" target="_blank">this</a> competition for the detection of the level of DR in these images. In this competition, we secured the position 37 on the Private and 55 among 2,943 teams on the Public leaderboard. Our model scored <b>0.829</b> on the public <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/leaderboard" target="_blank">LB</a> and <b>0.926</b> on the Private LB.

                <div class="description">Extraction of relevant pathological terms from radiology reports is important for correct image label generation and disease population studies. We published a paper titled <b>Pathology Extraction from Chest X-Ray Radiology Reports: A Performance Study</b> where we compared the performance of some known application program interfaces (APIs) for the task of thoracic abnormality extraction from radiology reports. We explored several medical domain-specific annotation tools like Medical Text Indexer (MTI) with Non-MEDLINE and MeSH On Demand (MOD) options and generic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API provided by the IBM cloud. Our results showed that although MTI and MOD are intended for extracting medical terms, their performance is worse compared to generic extraction APIs like IBM NLU. Finally, we trained a DNN-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract the key concept words from radiology reports. Our model outperformed the medical-specific and generic API performance by a large margin. Our results demonstrated the inadequacy of generic APIs for pathology extraction tasks and established the importance of domain-specific model training for improved results.

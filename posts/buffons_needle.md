## Buffon's Needle: A really weird way to find Pi

Pi (‚Å°œÄ) refers to the ratio of Circumference to diameter of any circle. It's a constant value (unless you are trying to measure ‚Å°œÄ from inside the Event horizon of a Blackhole!). It's also a transcendental number which means it can't be expressed as a root of a equation with integer co-efficients. Anyways, we've been able to find value of ‚Å°œÄ over 9 trillion digits after the decimal point!

The history of our attempt to find ‚Å°œÄ goes back to Archimedes' time. He tried to calculate ‚Å°œÄ using 4096 side polygon! Without any calculator, he was able to found out that value of œÄ should lie in between 3.1429 and 3.1408.

Discovery of Calculus in the 17th century opened a new window for estimating ‚Å°œÄ more precisely. Since then, we've seen plenty of methods to do it. Some of them are pretty weird but simple enough to understand. `Buffon's Needle Problem` is such one. This problem was first posed by the French Naturalist [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon) in 1733. It goes like this:
<br>

```
Suppose you are given a floor with equally spaced parallel lines on it. If we drop a needle on the floor, what is the probability that the needle will lie across a line?
```

<br>
Let's say you've thrown `n` needles(or a single needle for `n` times or whatever). `m` number of needles crosses/intersect with a line(or `m` times if you have one needle üòõ ). The the probability _`P`_ that a needle crosses the line: <br>

<br>

It may seems a bit odd that how on earth ‚Å°œÄ is related to this
problem. Hang on tight. I'll explain.

To solve this problem, we'll require some basic knowledge of `Probability` and `Integral Calculus`. Let's assume that the spacing between two consecutive parallel lines be _`D`_, length of needle be _`L`_. Now let the distance of the middle point of a needle on the floor to its closest line be _`x`_ and the acute angle between line and needle be `Œ∏`(See figure above). By the way, all needles are of equal length.

<center>![Buffon's Needle Problem.](data/buffon_explained.png)</center>
<br>
Since we are considering _`x`_ to be the smallest distance from the center of needle to any one of the lines, it can vary only within _`0`_ and _`D/2`_. And since `Œ∏` is an acute angle, it can take any value in between _`0`_ and _`‚Å°œÄ/2`_. Using trignonometry we can easily find out that, the vertical component of the length _`L`_ is `L/2 sinŒ∏`. The needle will cross the line if _`x`_ is greater than `L/2 sinŒ∏`. Let me write down these two conditions before I forget them:

<br>
<center><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x<L/2sin\theta" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x<L/2sin\theta" title="x<L/2sin\theta" /></a><br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=0<\theta<\pi/2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0<\theta<\pi/2" title="0<\theta<\pi/2" /></a> </center>

Okay. Now let's visualize possible outcomes in a graph. Let the horizontal axis be  `Œ∏` and vertical axis be _`x`_. So a rectangle with sides `œÄ/2` and `D/2` represents all possible outcomes in this experiment. <center><img src="data/1.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<center>**Horizontal axis refers to Œ∏ and vertical axis refers to x. The rectangle represents all possible outcomes**</center>
<br>Now I am going to shade all those points in the rectangle that represents the events where a needle crosses a line according to the two conditions above. Think about it. It's just the area under the curve `D/2 sinŒ∏` where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=0\leq\theta\leq\pi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0\leq\theta\leq\pi" title="0\leq\theta\leq\pi" /></a>
<br>
<br>
<center><img src="data/2.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<br><center>**The shaded area indicates the probability that a needle will cross a line**</center>
<br>Now the probability that we are looking for would be the ratio of the area under the `sine` curve and the rectangle.

Are of the rectangle:

Area under the `sine` curve: <br>
<center><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\int^{\pi/2}_0{L/2}\sin\theta&space;d\theta" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\int^{\pi/2}_0{L/2}\sin\theta&space;d\theta" title="\int^{\pi/2}_0{L/2}\sin\theta d\theta" /></a><br><br><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex==&space;L/2[-cos\theta]^{\pi/2}_0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?=&space;L/2[-cos\theta]^{\pi/2}_0" title="= L/2[-cos\theta]^{\pi/2}_0" /></a><br><br><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex==&space;L/2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?=&space;L/2" title="= L/2" /></a></center>
<br>
Ratio of the second and first area _i.e.,_ Probability _`P`_ that a needle will cross a line:<br> <br>
<center><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=L/2\bigg/\pi&space;D/4&space;=&space;2L\bigg/\pi&space;D" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L/2\bigg/\pi&space;D/4&space;=&space;2L\bigg/\pi&space;D" title="L/2\bigg/\pi D/4 = 2L\bigg/\pi D" /></a></center>

Rearranging a little, we get <br>

You have the value of evey term on the right side. Just put them in the equation. You'll get <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\pi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi" title="\pi" /></a> ! Just keep in mind, rules of probabilities tend to work fine when tested with a very large sample. Or in layman's term, you'll have to experiment with a large number of needles or throw them for a long time to get a pretty good estimation of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\pi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi" title="\pi" /></a>

How good this process actually is? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle#Estimating_%CF%80),

>In 1901, Italian mathematician Mario Lazzarini performed Buffon's needle experiment. Tossing a needle 3408 times, he obtained <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\pi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi" title="\pi" /></a> upto six decimal points correctly.

That's insane! Lazzarini was extremely lucky to find œÄ within only couple thousand trials. Normally it would take maybe million trials to get there. But you may get atleast two decimal ppoints correctly after a few hundred trials.

I myself created a simulation to do this experiment. You can see it below. It's throwing 'imaginary' needles to an 'imaginary' floor with parallel lines drawn on it and calculates <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\pi" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi" title="\pi" /></a>according to the formula obtained above and print on-screen. For a first few second it may say `Infinity` but don't bother. Give it some time to stabilise. You can make the throwing process faster buy pressing  `RIGHT` button if you get bored. Again if you want to slow it down, just press the `LEFT` key. 

At this point, you may ask, what is the application of this experiment in our life. The answer is `NOTHING!`. It's just a demonstration of the beauty of ‚Å°œÄ. Normally you can't relate throwing needle to a plane randomly to ‚Å°œÄ but as you've seen by now, they are related. When you are doing something randomly, thinking that you are the master of your own, nothing can controls you; well you are wrong! You are bounded by the rules of mathematics.

Isn't that beautiful?

        Buffon's Needle: A really weird way to find Pi
      </div>

<section class="section section-narrow-2 resources-section" id="all_resources">
  <div class="container">

    <p>Pi (‚Å°œÄ) refers to the ratio of Circumference to diameter of any circle. It's a constant value (unless you are trying to measure ‚Å°œÄ from inside the Event horizon of a Blackhole!). It's also a transcendental number which means it can't be expressed as a root of an equation with integer coefficients. Anyways, we've been able to find the value of ‚Å°œÄ over 9 trillion digits after the decimal point!</p>

    <center><img src="data/circle.jpg" width="50%"></center><br>

    <p>The history of our attempt to find ‚Å°œÄ goes back to Archimedes' time. He tried to calculate ‚Å°œÄ using a 4096 side polygon! Without any calculator, he was able to find that the value of œÄ should lie between 3.1429 and 3.1408.</p>

    <p>Discovery of Calculus in the 17th century opened a new window for estimating ‚Å°œÄ more precisely. Since then, we've seen plenty of methods to do it. Some of them are pretty weird but simple enough to understand. <code>Buffon's Needle Problem</code> is one of them. This problem was first posed by the French Naturalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a> in 1733. It goes like this:</p>

    <center>
        <blockquote>
            Suppose you are given a floor with equally spaced parallel lines on it. If we drop a needle on the floor, what is the probability that the needle will lie across a line?
        </blockquote>
    </center>

    <p>Let's say you've thrown <code>n</code> needles (or a single needle for <code>n</code> times or whatever). <code>m</code> number of needles cross/intersect with a line (or <code>m</code> times if you have one needle üòõ). The probability <em>P</em> that a needle crosses the line:</p>

    <center>\[ P = \frac{m}{n} \]</center>

    <center><img src="data/Buffonneedle.jpg" width="50%"></center><br>

    <center><em>Buffon's Needle Problem. The green needles are the ones crossing the parallel lines</em></center>

    <p>It may seem a bit odd how ‚Å°œÄ is related to this problem. Hang on tight. I'll explain.</p>

    <p>To solve this problem, we'll require some basic knowledge of <code>Probability</code> and <code>Integral Calculus</code>. Let's assume that the spacing between two consecutive parallel lines is <em>D</em>, the length of the needle is <em>L</em>. Now, let the distance from the middle point of a needle on the floor to its closest line be <em>x</em> and the acute angle between the line and needle be <em>Œ∏</em> (See figure above). All needles are of equal length.</p>

    <center><img src="data/buffon_explained.png" width="50%"></center>

    <p>Since we are considering <em>x</em> to be the smallest distance from the center of the needle to any one of the lines, it can vary only within <em>0</em> and <em>D/2</em>. And since <em>Œ∏</em> is an acute angle, it can take any value between <em>0</em> and <em>œÄ/2</em>. Using trigonometry, we can find out that the vertical component of length <em>L</em> is \( \frac{L}{2} \sin(\theta) \). The needle will cross the line if <em>x</em> is less than \( \frac{L}{2} \sin(\theta) \).</p>

    <center>\[ x < \frac{L}{2} \sin(\theta) \]</center>
    <center>\[ 0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \]</center>

    <p>Okay. Now let's visualize possible outcomes in a graph. Let the horizontal axis be <em>Œ∏</em> and the vertical axis be <em>x</em>. So a rectangle with sides \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( \frac{D}{2} \) represents all possible outcomes in this experiment.</p>

    <center><img src="data/1.jpg" width="50%"></center>

    <center><em>Horizontal axis refers to Œ∏ and vertical axis refers to x. The rectangle represents all possible outcomes</em></center>

    <p>Now I am going to shade all those points in the rectangle that represent the events where a needle crosses a line according to the two conditions above. Think about it. It's just the area under the curve \( \frac{D}{2} \sin(\theta) \) where \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi \).</p>

    <center><img src="data/2.jpg" width="50%"></center>

    <center><em>The shaded area indicates the probability that a needle will cross a line</em></center>

    <p>The probability we are looking for would be the ratio of the area under the <code>sine</code> curve and the rectangle.</p>

    <p>Area of the rectangle: \[ \frac{\pi D}{4} \]</p>

    <p>Area under the <code>sine</code> curve: \[ \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{L}{2} \sin(\theta) \, d\theta = \frac{L}{2} \]</p>

    <p>Ratio of the areas: \[ \frac{\frac{L}{2}}{\frac{\pi D}{4}} = \frac{2L}{\pi D} \]</p>

    <p>Rearranging, we get \[ \pi = \frac{2L}{P D} \]</p>

    <p>In 1901, Italian mathematician Mario Lazzarini performed Buffon's needle experiment and, tossing a needle 3408 times, obtained <em>œÄ</em> up to six decimal points correctly!</p>

    <p>I myself created a simulation to do this experiment. You can see it below. It's throwing 'imaginary' needles on an 'imaginary' floor with parallel lines and calculates <em>œÄ</em> based on the formula derived above. You can press <b>RIGHT ARROW</b> to make it go faster. Enjoy experimenting!</p>

    <p>Isn't that beautiful?</p>
